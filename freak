A Freak Trade is an erroneous trade where the price hits an abnormal level for a fraction of a second and then returns to the previous level. The error may happen due to manipulations, human errors, or technical glitches.

1. One of the instances of freak trades is “Fat Finger” trades that occur due to human error. Just like the typos in texting, traders and dealers in the securities markets can make typos when entering large orders. Erroneous trades caused by such typos, which set off a freak trade, are known as ‘fat finger’ trades.on

Consider this: In October 2012, a trader at a brokerage firm mixed up the volume and price columns that led to an erroneous sell order of ₹650 crores worth of Nifty stocks. It sparked a drop of 15% in the Nifty within minutes of the order placement.

2. On August 20, 2021, the call option contract for NSE’s main index Nifty  (16,450 strike price) for August expiry rose approximately 800% from around ₹135.8 to ₹803.05, causing a Freak trade.
